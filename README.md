# DeccoVR

A submission to the 2016 VR Hackathon in San Francisco, CA. 

DeccoVR was designed as a tool to let anyone step into VR and design a space, decorate it, and fill it with furniture -- all using their hands thanks to the HTC Vive. Spaces can be drawn by hand, or building shells can be imported from other software. At the end, when the headset is removed and the user returns to the real world, they're provided with a list of everything they selected, and a floor plan of what they designed. 

DeccoVR's prototype was built as an apartment design tool, but is flexible enough to be used for any number of building types.
